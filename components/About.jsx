                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>I&apos;ll spare you the &ldquo;I&apos;m not your average developer&rdquo; clich√©... Although, admittedly, my journey to web development has been a fairly unusual one!</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>I graduated with a Master&apos;s Degree in Chemical Engineering from University of Cambridge (UK) in 2007, and I have worked within Banking and Finance, Oil and Gas, Business Consulting, and Agriculture.</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>These industries all demanded similar skills - an analytical approach to problem-solving, creative adaptability under pressure, exceptional communication skills, and a commitment to delivering high-quality work. I believe that my unique blend of skills and experiences sets me apart as a developer.</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>I've been intrigued by technology for a long time, but it was while working on an EdTech passion project in 2022 that I truly got bitten by the programming bug. I became irrevocably fascinated by how logical and productive it is, and how impactful and empowering it can be - and I've been enchanted ever since!
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>
                I currently develop projects mainly in JavaScript, React.js and Next.js, with a very keen interest in keeping abreast of the ever-changing landscape of front-end technologies.
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-md'>My real passion lies in building an idea or vision into something that takes on a life of its own, with the capacity to solve problems and impact people.</p>
