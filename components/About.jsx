                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I won&apos;t stoop to the tired &ldquo;I&apos;m not your average developer&rdquo; clich√©... Although, admittedly, my journey to web development has been a fairly unusual one!</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I graduated with a Master&apos;s Degree in Chemical Engineering from University of Cambridge (UK) in 2007, and I have worked within Banking and Finance, Oil and Gas, Business Consulting, and Agriculture.</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>These varied roles all demanded an analytical approach to problem-solving, creative adaptability under pressure, exceptional communication skills, and a commitment to delivering high-quality work. I believe that my unique blend of skills and experiences sets me apart as a developer.</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I was working on an EdTech passion project in 2022, and I became irrevocably fascinated by the logical intricacy, potential impact and creative empowerment of programming. That&apos;s when I got bitten by the bug. 
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                I currently develop projects mainly in JavaScript, React.js and Next.js, with a keen interest in learning new technologies. 
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>My real passion is building an idea or vision into something that takes on a life of its own, with the ability to solve problems and impact lives.</p>
